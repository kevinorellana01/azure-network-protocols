<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe and inspect various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines using Wireshark. This project also involves experimenting with Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control traffic and analyzing different types of traffic protocols such as ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, and RDP.

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

The purpose of this project is to enhance understanding of network traffic flow and security configurations within cloud environments, providing foundational knowledge for managing and troubleshooting Azure-based networked systems.
